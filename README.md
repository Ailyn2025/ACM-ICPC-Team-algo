# ACM-ICPC-Team-algo
This code solves the ACM ICPC Team problem by finding the highest number of topics that a 2-person team can know and how many teams reach this highest number. The code changes binary topic strings into integers, combines knowledge with bitwise OR, counts the set bits to determine known topics, and keeps track of the maximum and the team count.
